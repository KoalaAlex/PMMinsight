                        <h4 class="section-heading">First of all: Can you give us a short statement about the new PMMinsight?</h4>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">The new PMMinsight is not focused on a book at all, but combines both of the topics Internet, 3D printing, packaging and also print. This can be regarded as a milestone! This is significant, especially in view of our new study orientation, since we have become a crossmedia and design-oriented study course which also includes 3D printing. As every semester, PMMinsight continues to offer the entire spectrum of industrial engineering: from planning, financing, development and production to marketing – all in the hands of students.</h3>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">As crossmedia, we think of communication campaigns that are cross-linked with different media channels. What do you think?</h4>
                        <h5 class="section-heading">What composition/networking of media channels do you find the most promising?</h5>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Although common media channels like TV, Internet or printing were mainly used for visuals in the past, it seems beneficial, in my opinion, to integrate crossmedia campaigns due to the increasing competitive pressure: For example, work clothing manufacturer Engelbert Strauss created an own song for marketing campaigns, in addition to the classic media, and was thus able to use audio channels in the era of visual overstimulation.</h3>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="section-heading">To what extent do you think will crossmedia continue to establish itself? The definition states that a minimum of 3 channels must be used - do you think that the campaigns will each utilize all channels soon, or are they already doing so?</h4>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">As I mentioned earlier, I think the auditory channel – whether through radio, television or the Internet – is an important additional component. In the future, it will probably be less a question of how many channels are used, but rather how channels can be combined: Due to the merging of communication channels in multi-functional devices, led by the smartphone, the integration of various types of advertising will play an important role in the future, in my opinion, because all channels can be received via one, but no more than two devices. This opens up new crossmedia approaches.</h3>

                        <h4 class="section-heading">You discuss crossmedia in your lectures. How did it come to interest you? What contact have you had with it in your career?</h4>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Early in 2000, I advised SME campaigns on the use of various advertising channels and their relationship to each other and made sure to use uniform design and a consistent motto. Decades earlier, there were marketing campaigns that could be called crossmedia campaigns from today's perspective. In those days, crossmedia was not yet or only rarely spoken of and barely investigated scientifically. Accordingly, the channels in the past were often used dependent on "luck" and connected to each other. It seems to me all the more important to further study crossmedia scientifically and to develop strategies and methods to increase the probability of success of advertising campaigns. Accordingly, we equip our students with this knowledge and motivate them to further research in this subject in the future. Last semester, I supervised a Bachelor thesis on crossmedia in the music industry and in personnel marketing. More crossmedia-related theses are being written. This shows the interest of the students in crossmedia.</h3>
